## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
- Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately
- Public disclosure can put users at risk

### 2. **DO** report via one of these methods:
- **Email**: [security@padinitz-code.com](mailto:security@padinitz-code.com)
- **Private Message**: Contact maintainers directly
- **Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private security advisory feature

### 3. **Include** the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### 4. **Response Timeline:**
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity (1-30 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user input
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper CORS policies

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use secure session management
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Validate user permissions on all endpoints

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper logging without exposing sensitive information

4. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Monitor security advisories for used packages

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique secrets for production
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Monitor network traffic for anomalies

3. **Access Control**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Implement multi-factor authentication when possible
   - Limit access to production systems
